# ðŸš€ 100 Days of Code â€“ Python Practice

Welcome to my Python learning journey!  
I am solving one program a day and building small projects to improve my coding skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure:
Each folder contains one project/practice code with its own README.md and source code.

## ðŸ’¡ Goal:
To become job-ready by building consistent habits, one program at a time.
