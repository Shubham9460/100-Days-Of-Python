# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator

This Python program converts any word into its NATO Phonetic Alphabet equivalent using data from a CSV file.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. Loads the `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv` file using **pandas**.
2. Creates a dictionary mapping each letter to its phonetic code using **dictionary comprehension** and `iterrows()`.
3. Takes a user input word.
4. Outputs the list of NATO phonetic codes for each letter in the word.
